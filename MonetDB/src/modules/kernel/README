The modules contained in the Kernel should not include any
code that requires analysis of the MAL instruction structure.
This way, we can link it with applications more easily.
(provided we define such routines as throwException)

As a consequence several 'old-fashioned' MIL constructs, e.g.
new(type1,type2) and print(type_any) are moved to the mal-service
layer.
